Should it be through a web interface, mobile app, or some other means? \n\n4. **Personalization**: Should the assistant offer personalized weather updates based on user preferences or location? If yes, how should it gather and manage user data?\n\n5. **Notifications**: Do you want the assistant to send notifications or alerts to users about severe weather conditions?\n\n6. **Integration**: Will the weather assistant need to integrate with any other applications or services?\n\n7. **User Demographics**: Who is the target audience for this weather assistant? Will it cater to a specific region or be global?\n\nThese questions will help us outline the functional requirements more clearly and ensure that we cover all necessary aspects in the specification."}, {"role": "user", "content": " Hello!
